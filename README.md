This is a C library that aims to provide useful functions for 
calculating neutrino oscialltion probabilities in two and three-
flavor frameworks. 

It currently builds on Mac OSX only, but fairly trivial adaptions to 
the Makefiles and setup scripts will enable the code to build on 
most Linux distributions as well.
