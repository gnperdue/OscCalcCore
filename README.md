This is a C library that aims to provide useful functions for 
calculating neutrino oscialltion probabilities in two and three-
flavor frameworks. 

It is under construction and not functional yet.

To build:

* source the setup.sh script. On Max OSX this will update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
On Linux, it will update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

* Type make. This will run an architecture dependent make. Currently only `uname` equals Darwin and Linux is resolved.
